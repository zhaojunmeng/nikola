Why Static Websites?
--------------------

Static websites are safer, use fewer resources, and avoid vendor and platform lockin.
You can read more about this in the [Nikola Handbook.](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/handbook.html#why-static)

What Can Nikola Do?
-------------------

It has many features, but here are some of the nicer ones:

* Blogs, with tags, feeds, archives, comments, etc.
* [Theming](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/theming.html)
* Fast builds, thanks to [doit](http://pydoit.org)
* Flexible
* Small codebase (programmers can understand all of Nikola in a couple of hours)
* [reStructuredText](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/quickstart.html) or [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) as input languages.
* Easy [image galleries](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/galleries/demo/) (just drop files in a folder!)
* Syntax highlighting for almost any programming language or markup
* Multilingual sites
* Doesn't reinvent wheels, leverages existing tools.
